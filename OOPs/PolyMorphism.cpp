// Polymorphism :- Polymorphism is a concept that allows you to
// perform a single action in different ways. Polymorphism is the
// combination of two Greek words. The poly means many, and morphs
// means forms. So polymorphism means many forms.

// Real-life example:  A person at the same time can have different
// characteristics. Like a man at the same time is a father, a husband,
// and an employee. So the same person possesses different behavior in
// different situations. This is called polymorphism.

// There are two types of polymorphism in C++.
//   Compile - time polymorphism
//-> Function Overloading
//-> operator overlaoding
//   Runtime polymorphism
