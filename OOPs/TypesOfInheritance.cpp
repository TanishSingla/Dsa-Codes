    1. Single Inheritance :
        In single inheritance,
        one class can extend the functionality of another class.In single inheritance,
        there is only one parent class and one child class.

    2. Multilevel Inheritance:
        When a class inherits from a derived class, and the derived class becomes the base class
        of the new class, it is called multilevel inheritance. In multilevel inheritance,
        there is more than one level.
        Class A
          ðŸ”»
        Class B
          ðŸ”»
        Class C

    3. Multiple Inheritance:
    In multiple inheritance, a class can inherit more than one class.
    This means that in this type of inheritance, a single child class can have multiple parent classes.

    Class A      Class B
       ðŸ”»          ðŸ”»
            Class C

    Syntax :-
    class child_class: access_modifier parent_class1, access_modifier parent_class2 {
    //Body of child class};

    4. Hierarchical Inheritance:
    In hierarchical inheritance, one class serves as a base class for more than one derived class.

    Hybrid Inheritance:


    5.Hybrid inheritance:
    is a combination of more than one type of inheritance.
    For example, A child and parent class relationship that follows multiple and
    hierarchical inheritances can be called hybrid inheritance.
